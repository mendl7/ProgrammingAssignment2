## This function creates a special "matrix" object 
## that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}



## This function either calculates the inverse of the 
## "matrix" object created by makeCacheMatrix() or,
## if this has been previously calculated and the 
## matrix hasn't been altered, retrieves the inverse
## of the matrix object from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
